// Always use the 'uv' package manager for installing, managing, and running Python packages and environments whenever possible, instead of pip, pipx, poetry, venv, or other Python tooling. 
// All Python-related install, run, or environment tasks should leverage the 'uv' CLI as the default and preferred method.
// If a project requires Python dependency management, use 'uv pip install -r requirements.txt' or 'uv venv', and for running Python scripts, use 'uv venv' where appropriate.
// Wherever applicable, prefer uv commands (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) over legacy pip-based solutions for Python workflows.
